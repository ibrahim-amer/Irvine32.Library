# Irvine32.Library 
Irvine32 library for handling input-output and string handling in assembly language programming. 


## Code Structure ## 
There are two projects in this solution:
1.  Irvine32_Library: contains irvine32.inc and irvine32.asm files which contains all the functions written by Kip R. Irvine for handling I/O operations in assembly language (MASM32).
2. Project_Template: a sample project for a program written with assembly language to test irvine32 library.

After building/rebuilding Irvine32_Library project, a new .Lib file will be generated and copied automatically to Project_Template directory to test it.
